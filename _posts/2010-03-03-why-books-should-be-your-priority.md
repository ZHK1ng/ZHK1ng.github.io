## Week1 Schedule
At 16:00 on September 5, our team had the first offline meeting with Professor Kim Young-taek. During the meeting, we put forward several ideas and plans.




## Project Content

As an important material handling equipment in industrial production, crane is widely used in construction, manufacturing, port, storage and other fields. The main goal of the crane graduation design project is to design an efficient, safe and economical crane equipment through the combination of theory and practice to meet the needs of load handling in a specific working environment.

Project Background:
With the development of modern industry, the demand for material handling is gradually increasing, and traditional lifting equipment is facing the problems of low efficiency, high energy consumption, and insufficient intelligence level. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to design a crane with high load capacity, easy operation, easy maintenance and in line with safety standards.

### Design Content:
1. ** Demand analysis ** : Clarify the application scenario, working environment and technical requirements of the crane, such as lifting weight, lifting height, working radius, etc.
2. ** Structural design ** : Select the type of crane (such as bridge, portal or tower) according to the demand, and design its key components, including the main beam, hook, wire rope, hoist, etc.
3. ** Mechanical calculation ** : Calculate the strength, stiffness and stability of the main parts of the crane to ensure that the design meets the safety and durability requirements.
4. ** Transmission and control system design ** : Design motor drive system and control system to achieve accurate control and safe operation of the crane.
5. ** Material selection and processing ** : Select the appropriate materials and plan the manufacturing process to ensure the strength and durability of the structure, while reducing costs.
6. Safety and Environmental protection: Design protection devices that meet international safety standards, and consider reducing energy consumption and environmental pollution.
7. **3D Modeling and simulation ** : Using CAD and other software for 3D modeling, and through the simulation software for mechanical properties and operation simulation, to verify the feasibility and stability of the design.

### Project innovation:
- The use of lightweight materials to improve structural strength while reducing self-weight;
- Intelligent control system is introduced to realize automation and remote monitoring of lifting operations;
- Integrated safety protection system to prevent overloading, overturning and other dangerous conditions.

### Expected Results:
Through the design and implementation of the project, students will master the basic principles and methods of crane design, and have the ability to design the whole process from demand analysis to practical application. The final product will include a complete set of design drawings, mechanical calculation reports and simulation analysis results to provide a reference for crane design in the industrial sector.
